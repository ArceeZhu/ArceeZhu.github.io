## when do people always shop? 
```{r}
data("instacart")
instacart =
  instacart %>% 
  select ( order_id, order_hour_of_day, aisle, department ) %>% 
  filter(! department=="missing")
 
```

```{r}
instacart |>
  plot_ly(
    x = ~order_hour_of_day, 
  y = ~ department, type = "box", 
  color = ~ department, 
  mode = "markers", colors = "viridis")

```
we can see that people usually shopping between 10 to 15 o'clock. 


## what kind of things do people shop in the morning? 
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  filter (department %in% c("bakery", "breakfast", "canned food", "diary egg", "deli", "dry good pasta", "frozen", "meat seafood", "pantry","snack")) %>% 
  filter(! department=="missing") %>% 
  filter(department=="meat seafood") %>% 
  select ( order_id, order_hour_of_day, aisle, department )  %>% 
  group_by(order_hour_of_day) %>% 
  count (aisle) %>% 
  plot_ly (x = ~ order_hour_of_day, y= ~ n, type = "scatter", mode="makers", color = ~ aisle )
 
 
  
```
