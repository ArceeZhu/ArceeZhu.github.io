## when do people always shop? 
```{r}
data("instacart")
instacart1 =
  instacart %>% 
  filter(! department=="missing") %>% 
  mutate(hour_of_day=order_hour_of_day, category=department) %>% 
  select ( order_id, hour_of_day, aisle, category) 
 
```

```{r}
instacart1 |>
  plot_ly(
  x = ~ hour_of_day, y = ~ category, type = "box", 
  color = ~ category, mode = "markers", colors = "viridis") %>% 
  layout(title = "Grocerry Shopping By Category")

```
we can see that people usually shopping between 10 to 15 o'clock. 


## What are the  patterns of people buying meat and seafood people along the day? 
```{r}
  instacart1 %>% 
  filter(category=="meat seafood") %>% 
  select ( order_id, hour_of_day, aisle, category)  %>% 
  group_by(hour_of_day, aisle) %>% 
  summarise(number=n()) %>% 
  mutate(text_label=str_c("hour_of_day:", hour_of_day,  "\nnumber:", number)) %>% 
  plot_ly (x = ~ hour_of_day, y= ~ number, type = "scatter", mode="makers", color = ~ aisle , text= ~ text_label) %>% 
  layout(title = "Meat and Seafood Shopping By Time")
 
 
  
```

### What does the percentage of each aisle in snacks look like?

```{r}
  instacart1 %>% 
  filter(category == "snacks") %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  plot_ly (labels = ~ aisle, values=~ count, type="pie") %>% 
  layout(title = " Snacks Shopping By Category ")

```
